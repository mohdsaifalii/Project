    <h2>Why I Love It</h2>
    <p>I love cricket because it embodies a perfect blend of skill, strategy, and teamwork. The thrill of a fast-paced Twenty20 match, where every ball can change the game's outcome, contrasts beautifully with the endurance and tactical depth of a five-day Test match, offering something for every mood and moment. The sound of leather on willow, the sight of a bowler's perfectly executed delivery, and the elegance of a batsman's stroke evoke a sense of tradition and artistry that few sports can match. Cricket's rich history, global appeal, and the passionate community it fosters further deepen my appreciation, making it more than just a game, but a lifelong passion.</p>
